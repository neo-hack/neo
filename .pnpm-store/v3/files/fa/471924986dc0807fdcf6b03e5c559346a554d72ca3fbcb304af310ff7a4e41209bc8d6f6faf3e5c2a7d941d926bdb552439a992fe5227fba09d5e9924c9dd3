## Possible Reason

An error occurred while building the dll file. Since the dependencies under dependencies will all be build into the dll, the error may be caused by the following reasons:

1. Some dependencies in dependencies do not have a main file
2. The node-related dependencies that should be placed in devDependencies are written in dependencies

## Solution

Exclude dependencies that shouldn't in dll to dll, there are several solutions:

1. Put node related dependencies in devDependencies
2. Configure the error dependencies into the exclude of the dll

e.g.

```
dll: {
  exclude: ['foo']
}
```
