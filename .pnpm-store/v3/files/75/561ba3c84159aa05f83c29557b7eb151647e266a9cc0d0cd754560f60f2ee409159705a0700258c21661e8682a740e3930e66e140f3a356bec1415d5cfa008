## Possible Reason

The configured plugin cannot be resolved.

## Solution

A few ideas,

1. If the plugin is an npm package, install this plugin via yarn or npm
2. If the plugin is a relative path, make sure the path is relative to the project root directory

> Note: The plugin is also relative to the project root when the configuration file is `config/config.js`.
